=head1 NAME

File::PlainPath - Construct portable filesystem paths in a simple way

=head1 VERSION

version 0.011

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use File::PlainPath;
    
    # Forward slash is the default directory separator
    my $path = path 'dir/subdir/file.txt';
    
    # Set backslash as directory separator
    use File::PlainPath '\\';   
    my $other_path = path 'dir\\other_dir\\other_file.txt';

    # Forward slash is the default directory separator, but function name is to_path
    use File::PlainPath to_path => '/';   
    my $path = to_path 'dir/subdir/file.txt';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

File::PlainPath translates filesystem paths that use a common directory
separator to OS-specific paths. It allows you to replace constructs like this:

    my $path = File::Spec->catfile('dir', 'subdir', 'file.txt');

with a simpler notation:

    my $path = path 'dir/subdir/file.txt';

The default directory separator used in paths is the forward slash (C</>), but
any other character can be designated as the separator:

    use File::PlainPath ':';
    my $path = path 'dir:subdir:file.txt';

=head1 IMPORT

When importing File::PlainPath, if no arguments are given, the imported function is C<path> and it uses the separator C</>. Called with one argument, the function is still called C<path> but the separator is now that argument. Called with two arguments the first is the function name and the second is the separator. For examples see L</SYNOPSIS>.
